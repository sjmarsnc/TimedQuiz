Spacing in top row -  why does it stack too early?  
* Sort scores in table 
* check for existing score with those initials 
* timers - if run out of time end quiz  
* only show correct/incorrect for 2 seconds (1.5?) 
* color change when hover over button
* round the buttons a bit? 
x color change if wrong answer / right answer?  decided not to because you have 
    the correct/incorrect text with timeout - more interesting coding 
* sound when wrong 
* keep accurate score (add for correct values)  
* not getting the right score when timeout  
? clear initials after storing them?  or assume that the same person is trying
   again? 
* when clear high scores must clear the content of the table displayed
* align the timer on the right, fix how/when it stacks
