# TimedQuiz
Timed Quiz application - homework 4

This project is to create a timed quiz.  Questions are presented to the user and they must select the correct answer.  If they select the wrong answer, they hear a buzzer and the text "Incorrect" is shown for 2 seconds.  Correct answers get a bonus of 10 points, incorrect answers cause a deduction of 10 points.   At the end of the quiz any time left is added to the score.  The highest score for any set of initials is saved in local storage, and the high scores can be displayed using the "See High Scores" link in the upper left corner of the page, or after a quiz is completed and the score registered.  High scores are sorted in descending order by score.  

The page is implemented by creating each section as a div and hiding or displaying it depending on where the user is in the sequence.  

Questions are stored in a separate questions.js file, making it easy to set up different sets of questions on different topics.
